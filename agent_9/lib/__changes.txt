Scores
- think why sometimes I leave the fragment. Usually I lose 1 point from this
- does not look like I occupy enemy fragments
- do not handle a situation when unit retook my fragment

Enemy interaction
- when you shoot in the dark estimate how much energy a unit there should have
- moving from one position to another when next to enemy occurs because I am afraid to collide with him
- losing units because people walk into me when I am WAITING or COLLECTING FRAGMENTS (move from it)
- think about remembering where all units were before and have some TTL. Which is depends on the energy, fragmeg
- be more aggressive when coming to fragments
- Maybe do not attack if energy gained is < than I lose

Other
- do not assume enemy at fragment will move. for path-finder
- in hungarian solver, should I add units from the future
- think to boost position of good nebula tiles next to enemy
- if I have more points and delta increasing is the same, then just defend
